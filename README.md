# Master Thesis: Advanced Image Processing for Urban Vegetation Cataloging
## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Master Thesis! This project is focused on the use of advanced image processing tools to catalog and characterize vegetation in urban environments. We analyze sequences captured by geopositioned cameras on moving vehicles, employing techniques like semantic segmentation, plant species classification, and vegetation density determination.

## Project Description
This Master Thesis explores the use of advanced image processing tools for cataloging and characterizing vegetation in urban environments. Sequences captured by a geopositioned camera on a moving vehicle are analyzed using semantic segmentation algorithms, plant species classification, vegetation density determination. This allows for a detailed segmentation of vegetation, significantly improving the understanding of its distribution and density in urban settings. The reidentification of vegetation in images captured at different time intervals enables long-term monitoring of vegetation evolution, allowing observation of growth trends, responses to urban interventions, and seasonal changes. Additionally, the use of a plant species classifier is investigated, a key tool for enhancing the specificity of the catalog. Obtaining vegetation density based on position provides information about the spatial distribution and abundance of plant species in urban environments. This project, which aims to create an updated and comprehensive vegetation register in urban environments like the UAM campus, includes a vegetation catalog that integrates spatio-temporal data.
